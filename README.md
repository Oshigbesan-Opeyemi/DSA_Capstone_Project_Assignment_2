# Palmora Group HR 
## HR and Salary Analysis
This project expolres the alleged "gender bias" in Palmora Group, a manufacturing company based in Nigeria (currently under fire for gender inequality by the media) across all departments as they try to spread out to other regions of the country and worldwide.

## Project Overview
This project features a range of PBI skills as the method adopted in analyzing the company employee and salary data based on the gender disparities in all departments within the company and across all regions where the company is located in Nigeria to give actionable insights that will bridge the gender gap to the company CEO and HRO.

## Project Objective
This analysis was carried out majorly to bring gender equality to the company such that the media harrasments will die down and give the company a breakthrough nation and worldwide.

### Data Sources
The employee data [Palmora emp data] is an excel file while the bonus data [Bonus rules] is a csv file shared with the class on our learning platform.

## Tools Used
The analysis was carried out with Microsoft Power BI Desktop app with the Power Query Editor as the major analysis tool.

## Data Cleaning And Preparation
Every cleaning and transformation were carried out in the Power Query Editor of the PBI Desktop.

## Projects
Analyzing this data brought about the following tasks:
 * Data importation from Ms. Excel and csv files
 * Data transformation which includes:
   - Changing data type of columns with values
   - Filtering out 'null' and 'empty spaces' in columns
   - Removing rows of employees who have resigned or retired
   - Adding custom and conditional columns where needed
   - Grouping columns thereby creating new tables
   - Merging tables together
   - Aggregations such as sum, average, count etc.
   - Sorting column order by creating a new column for "sort order" and sorting the previous with the new one
   - Using Dax formulas to create measures etc...
 * Data loading into the model to create visuals and establish relationships between tables

## Exploratory Data Analysis
To better understand the data and analyze it, there were two case scenarios raised by the company

### Case I
 #### Employee Gender Discrimination
 This case discusses all issues concerning gender like:
  * The gender distribution of the company across all departments and regions
  * The company's salary structure based on gender, department and region
  * The gender pay gap. That is, the difference in salaries of males and females
  * The performance rating for all employees also gender based
  * Minimum wage (90k) compliance as required by government regulation 
  * Salary distribution into bands of 10k
All of which were visualised in the PBI report page

### Case II
#### Salary and Bonus
This case discusses all matters relating to salary and bonus payment to all employees

## Insights
The following are the observations arrived at when analysing this data:
 * The company has more male employees than females
 * The total salary for the males is higher compared to the females
 * The males were rated better than the females in terms of performance
 * The company did not meet the minimum wage required by regulation
It is safe to say that the Company is very gender biased

## Recommendations
To bridge the gender inequality gap, the CEO and HRO need to come together to:
 * Review their employment requirement and policies to allow more females
 * Promote more females into top positions to shut the media up
 * Base salary payment on educational and promotion level rather than gender as is done in the government sector
 * Increase overall salary payment to all employees as many of their sataff are paid below the minimum wage
 * Look into the South West and North Cenrtal regions to find out why they have the highest pay gap compared to the North West
 * Share a questioneer with the staff to collect data on how best to dissolve the gender bias in the company
 * And lastly, in a bid to bridge the company gender gap, the company shouldn't become sentimental as that will not help their profitability
